# Getting Started Tips

- Use `python main.py` to launch the graphical interface.
- User data is stored under `users/<yourname>`.
- You can extend the app by adding modules to the `plugins/` directory.
- Run `pytest` to verify everything works after changes.

- Use `python tool.py` for one-stop commands:
  - `python tool.py run` starts the app
  - `python tool.py create-user NAME` sets up a user folder
  - `python tool.py test` runs the test suite
  - `python tool.py list-plugins` shows optional extensions
